# Global Constitution Technology Matrix

## Core Principles

### I. Phase I: In-Memory Console Application
Phase I applications must remain as in-memory console applications only. No web frontend, database, or authentication systems are permitted during this phase. Focus on core business logic and algorithmic implementation in a standalone console environment.

### II. Phase II: Full-Stack Web Application
Phase II applications must implement the following technology stack:
- Backend: Python REST API
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- ORM/Data layer: SQLModel or equivalent
- Frontend: Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- Authentication: Better Auth (signup/signin)
- Architecture: Full-stack web application

### III. Phase III and Later: Advanced Systems
Phase III and subsequent phases may incorporate advanced cloud infrastructure, agents, and AI orchestration systems. AI and agent frameworks are prohibited until Phase III and later.

### IV. Phase Isolation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Technology usage is strictly governed by phase requirements:
- Authentication is allowed starting Phase II
- Web frontend is allowed starting Phase II
- Neon PostgreSQL is allowed starting Phase II
- No AI or agent frameworks until later phases
- Each phase must be completed before advancing to the next

### V. Technology Compliance
All implementations must strictly adhere to the approved technology stack for the current phase. Deviations require constitutional amendment and explicit approval.

### VI. Architecture Evolution
Applications must be designed with phase progression in mind, allowing for smooth transitions between phases while maintaining compliance with current phase requirements.

## Technology Stack Requirements

### Phase I Stack:
- In-memory console application only
- No persistent storage
- No web interface
- No authentication systems

### Phase II Stack:
- Backend: Python REST API
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- ORM/Data layer: SQLModel or equivalent
- Frontend: Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- Authentication: Better Auth
- Architecture: Full-stack web application

### Phase III+ Stack:
- Advanced cloud infrastructure
- AI and agent frameworks
- Enhanced orchestration systems

## Development Workflow

### Phase Compliance Review:
- All PRs must verify compliance with current phase requirements
- Technology stack restrictions must be enforced
- Architecture decisions must align with phase-appropriate technologies
- Migration plans required for phase transitions

## Governance

This constitution serves as the authoritative technology policy for all phases of development. All development activities must comply with the current phase requirements and approved technology stack.

Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation of changes, approval process, and migration plan for any existing code that may be affected. The phase isolation rules preserve the structured evolution of applications from simple console applications to complex AI-powered systems.
